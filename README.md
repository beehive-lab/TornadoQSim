# TornadoQSim

Simulator of quantum circuits implemented in Java and accelerated with [TornadoVM](https://www.tornadovm.org/). Developed by Ales Kubicek as part of the 3rd year project at the University of Manchester.

**Planned approach:**
* Front-end circuit composer 
* REST API
* Simulator
  * Unitary matrix simulator
  * High order tensor network simulator
  * Resource estimator
