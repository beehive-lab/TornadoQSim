# TornadoQSim - Evaluation

Three quantum algorithms were chosen to evaluate the performance of the TornadoQSim:

- Fully entangled quantum circuit
- Deutschâ€“Jozsa algorithm
- Quantum Fourier Transform

## Performance Graphs

The evaluation results can be found in [graphs/data.py](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoQSim/blob/develop/evaluation/graphs/data.py) and plotted using [graphs/plot_time.py](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoQSim/blob/develop/evaluation/graphs/plot_time.py) and [graphs/plot_memory.py](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoQSim/blob/develop/evaluation/graphs/plot_memory.py).

The performance of other quantum computing frameworks (namely Qiskit, Strange and Cirq) for some of the experiments was included in the data. The implementation of the quantum algorithms using those other frameworks can be found in the appropriate sub-folders.
